# Lab 1.07: Pandas Manipulation, Plotting, and Merging

In this lab, you will be looking at a data set from the Austin Animal Shelter from 2015. You will use data on rescue animal intakes and outcomes. 

First, you will examine the animals themselves, and look at some descriptive data. For a challenge, you will also look at animal timelines and outcomes to see what happens to them. 

This lab focuses on the "PARSE THE DATA" and "MINE THE DATA" steps of the data science workflow.
